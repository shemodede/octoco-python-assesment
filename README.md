All files can be run by invoking the file by name on the terminal/command-line in the project base folder.
i.e. `python <filename>.py`.

Where inputs are required (question 4) a call can be made in the following format with `-i` or `--filename` denoting the input string.
  
  
  `python question_4.py -i "Input string" -r <number of rounds> -d "Database file name"`
  

Tests can be run using the following command:

    `python -m unittest`


Thanks.
